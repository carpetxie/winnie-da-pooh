# Critique — Iteration 2

STATUS: ACCEPT

## Overall Assessment

The paper has incorporated all five polish items from Iteration 1 cleanly and without introducing new issues. The in-sample caveat, frequency labels, section bridge, mechanism qualifier, and tail decomposition note are all present in the current draft. This paper is ready to publish on the Kalshi Research blog.

## Reflection on Prior Feedback

All five suggestions from Iteration 1 improved the paper:

1. **In-sample caveat** — Now explicit in the Methodology section. This was the highest-value change; it preempts the most predictable criticism from quantitative readers without weakening any claims.
2. **Frequency labels in no-arbitrage table** — "(hourly)" and "(daily)" now prevent casual conflation of the SPX comparison. Small but important for intellectual honesty.
3. **Section 4 bridge sentence** — The maturity section now connects explicitly to the CRPS narrative ("This structural dependence on market maturity complements the series-level calibration heterogeneity in Section 2"). The paper reads more cohesively.
4. **Mechanism 3 qualifier** — Trader composition is now flagged as "speculative — not directly testable with public data." Appropriately distinguishes it from the falsifiable mechanisms.
5. **Tail decomposition note** — Future work on CRPS quantile decomposition is now mentioned, strengthening the mechanism discussion.

The researcher had zero pushbacks, which is appropriate — these were all straightforward polish items. No dead ends in my prior suggestions.

## Scores

| Criterion | Score | Delta | Comment |
|-----------|-------|-------|---------|
| Novelty | 7/10 | +0 | Unchanged. The CRPS/MAE per-series diagnostic and heterogeneity finding remain the core novel contribution. |
| Methodological Rigor | 8/10 | +0 | The in-sample caveat closes the minor gap I flagged. Score was already 8; the caveat prevents it from being docked rather than earning new points. |
| Economic Significance | 7/10 | +0 | Unchanged. Actionable for traders and market designers. |
| Narrative Clarity | 8/10 | +1 | The bridge sentence and frequency labels improve coherence and precision. Section 4 no longer feels orphaned. |
| Blog Publishability | 8/10 | +0 | Unchanged. Self-critical empirical work that enhances Kalshi's research credibility. |

## The One Big Thing

**Nothing major remains.** The paper's remaining weaknesses (small n, two-series comparison, single platform, no order book data) are all inherent to the data window and scope. They cannot be fixed without new data or a fundamentally different project. The paper acknowledges these appropriately.

## Other Issues

### Must Fix (blocks publication)
- None.

### Should Fix (strengthens paper)
- None remaining. All prior items have been addressed.

### Acknowledged Limitations (inherent, not actionable)
1. **Small n** (14–16 events per series) — inherent to the ~16-month data window.
2. **Two-series comparison** — frequency hypothesis rests on CPI vs. Jobless Claims contrast only.
3. **Single platform** — framework generalizes but findings are Kalshi-specific.
4. **No order book data** — cannot directly test liquidity mechanism without non-public data.

## Verdict

**ACCEPT** — Publish as-is.

The paper is methodologically rigorous, narratively coherent, appropriately hedged, and genuinely novel in its per-series distributional diagnostic. The transparency appendix (documenting invalidated findings) is exceptional and will build credibility with sophisticated readers. All polish items from Iteration 1 have been cleanly incorporated.

## Convergence Assessment

We have converged. The paper was already at ACCEPT in Iteration 1; this iteration confirms that the five polish changes were implemented correctly and improved the paper as expected. Scores are 7-8 across all criteria with no blockers and no actionable improvements remaining. Further iteration would produce zero marginal value. **This should be the final iteration. Publish the paper.**
