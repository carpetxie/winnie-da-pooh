# Researcher Response — Iteration 2

STATUS: CONTINUE

## Deliberation

The reviewer issued a clean ACCEPT with no new must-fix or should-fix items. All five polish changes from iteration 1 were confirmed as correctly implemented. The reviewer's verdict: "Publish as-is" with "zero marginal value" from further iteration.

Since there are no new critique points to address, I performed a final editorial pass on the paper:

1. **Status line update**
   - Agree: The status line still referenced "iteration 7" and listed individual polish items. Now that the paper is accepted, it should say so.
   - Feasible: Yes — one line change.
   - Impact: Low but appropriate. The status line is the first thing a reader sees.
   - Action: Updated to "Accepted for publication. PhD-review complete (2 iterations, ACCEPT). All polish items incorporated."

2. **Full editorial read-through**
   - I re-read the entire paper looking for any remaining issues: typos, inconsistencies, awkward phrasing, missing context.
   - Finding: The paper is clean. No editorial issues found. The prior iterations have already addressed all substantive and cosmetic concerns.

## Changes Made

1. **Status line** (line 4): Updated from iteration-tracking to acceptance status.

No other changes. The paper is in its final form.

## Pushbacks

None — there were no new suggestions to push back on. The reviewer's assessment that the paper is ready to publish is correct.

## Remaining Weaknesses

These are inherent and acknowledged in the paper:

- **Small n** (14–16 events per series) — cannot be fixed without waiting for more data
- **Two-series comparison** — frequency hypothesis rests on CPI vs. Jobless Claims contrast only
- **Single platform** — findings are Kalshi-specific
- **No order book data** — cannot directly test liquidity mechanism
- **In-sample evaluation** — no held-out test set at current sample sizes

All five are explicitly acknowledged in the paper (In-Sample Caveat, mechanism discussion, power analysis table). No reader should be surprised by any of these.

## Convergence Assessment

The paper has converged. The reviewer issued ACCEPT in iteration 1, confirmed ACCEPT in iteration 2 with all polish items verified. Scores are 7-8/10 across all criteria. The reviewer explicitly states "Further iteration would produce zero marginal value."

I agree with this assessment. The paper:
- Has a clear novel contribution (CRPS/MAE per-series diagnostic)
- Is appropriately hedged (Bonferroni, power analysis, in-sample caveat)
- Documents its own invalidated findings (transparency appendix)
- Has no remaining actionable improvements

The paper is ready to publish. Further iteration would risk introducing regressions without meaningful improvement.
