Clean — no stale Section 4 references. All changes are complete.

**Summary of iteration 8 changes:**

1. **Section 4 → Appendix D**: Demoted the Market Maturity and Calibration section (Brier-score analysis on binary contracts) from a body section to Appendix D. This tightens the paper to three focused body sections: Methodology → CRPS/MAE Diagnostic → Information Hierarchy. Added a forward pointer from Section 2's snapshot sensitivity discussion and a framing sentence in the appendix.

2. **Abstract restructured**: Split the dense single-paragraph abstract into two paragraphs — (i) question + headline findings + maturity pattern, (ii) supporting evidence (PIT, horse race, TIPS, power). Added the TIPS Granger result which was previously absent from the abstract. Reduced CI clutter for blog readability.

3. **p-value consistency**: Changed all instances of "p_adj=0.10" to "p_adj=0.102" to match the horse race table.

4. **Worked example caveat**: Added a note that the examples are selected to illustrate the mechanism at its clearest, with series medians provided for context.

No pushbacks this iteration — all critique points were valid and actionable. The paper is now structurally tight with a clean three-section arc for a blog audience.
