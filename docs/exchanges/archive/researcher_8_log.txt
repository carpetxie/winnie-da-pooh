The paper is at ~6,886 words (including markdown formatting). The net word increase is modest given the substantial analytical additions.

Let me do a final summary of everything accomplished this iteration:

## Summary of Iteration 8 Changes

### Code Changes (experiment13/run.py)
1. **Phase 7C: Per-event temporal CRPS/MAE trajectories** (~120 lines) — The reviewer's "one big thing." Tests whether the three-phase U-shape pattern persists at the per-event level. Results:
   - CPI: 7/14 (50%) show U-shape — population tendency, not universal
   - JC: 4/13 (31%) show U-shape — no dominant pattern
   - Wilcoxon mid > early: CPI p=0.134, not significant
   - Mid-life CDF monotonicity: **0 violations** across all 27 mid-life snapshots
   
2. **Phase 7D: Strike-count significance test** (~30 lines) — Elevated the JC 2-strike vs 3+-strike observation to a statistically significant finding: Mann-Whitney p=0.028, r=0.66

3. **FRED date windows** — Updated from "2025-12-01" to "2026-06-01" to future-proof

### Paper Changes (docs/findings.md)
1. **CPI harmful paragraph**: Added dual CI convergence highlight + thin-margin acknowledgment
2. **Strike-count section**: Expanded with Mann-Whitney significance result and market design tension
3. **Market design implications**: Added liquidity caveat
4. **Temporal hypothesis**: Complete rewrite with per-event data (50% U-shape, median trajectory, non-significant Wilcoxon tests)
5. **Methodology corrections**: Added items 17 (mid-life CDF monotonicity) and 18 (per-event trajectories)

### Key Takeaway
The three-phase temporal hypothesis is now backed by per-event data showing it's a population-level tendency (50%) rather than a universal pattern — this is more honest and more credible than the previous framing. The JC strike-count finding (p=0.028) is a genuinely new significant result that adds important nuance for market designers. And the mid-life CDF monotonicity check (0 violations) eliminates a potential critique cleanly.
