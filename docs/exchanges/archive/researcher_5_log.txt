Here's a summary of what I did for iteration 5:

## Summary of Changes

**Discovery**: The iteration 4 changes (worked examples, market design implications, event breakdown fix, B-L citation, Section 3 title) were missing from `findings.md`. I restored all of them from the original data.

**Iteration 5 critique responses** (all accepted):

1. **One Big Thing — Ratio estimation bias note**: Added a sentence to the bootstrap CI footnote acknowledging O(1/n) upward bias from Jensen's inequality, citing Efron & Tibshirani (1993). This proactively addresses what quantitative readers at Kalshi would notice.

2. **Should Fix #1 — CPI example → market design forward-reference**: Added "This is exactly the scenario where additional strikes would help" at the end of the CPI worked example, closing the loop for non-linear readers.

3. **Should Fix #2 — Abstract precision**: Changed "rules out strike-count differences" to "shows strike-count differences explain <5% of the CPI penalty" — matching the body's more precise language.

4. **Should Fix #3 — PIT integration into hypothesis list**: Restructured the PIT analysis from a trailing paragraph into a bolded "Differential diagnosis via PIT analysis" block between the hypotheses and future work, making the logical payoff more prominent.

**No pushbacks this iteration** — all four suggestions were well-targeted and feasible.
