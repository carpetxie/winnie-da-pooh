Everything looks clean. Here's a summary of what was done in this iteration:

## Iteration 7 Summary

### Code Changes
- **experiment13/run.py**: Added Phase 7B (~50 lines) with three new analyses:
  1. **Spearman rank correlation** between surprise magnitude and per-event CRPS/MAE ratio
  2. **AR(1) autocorrelation** of per-event ratios across chronologically ordered events
  3. **Conditional CRPS/MAE** by inflation surprise direction (CPI only)

### Key New Results
- **CPI surprise magnitude correlation**: ρ=−0.68, p=0.008 — distributions fail more on *small* surprises, not large ones. This is the most analytically significant new finding.
- **JC surprise magnitude correlation**: ρ=−0.55, p=0.029 — same pattern, confirming it's a general property
- **Per-event autocorrelation**: CPI AR(1)=0.12, JC AR(1)=0.04 — distributional quality is approximately independent across events, making the block bootstrap conservative
- **Conditional CPI by direction**: Upside inflation (n=9) CRPS/MAE=1.34, downside (n=5) CRPS/MAE=2.22 — dominated by the small-MAE mechanical effect

### Paper Changes (docs/findings.md)
1. Scoped "first empirical demonstration" to "in prediction markets" (abstract + Section 3)
2. Added new subsection "Surprise Magnitude: When Do Distributions Fail?" with Spearman table and interpretation
3. Added per-event autocorrelation note to block bootstrap paragraph
4. Fixed PIT claim consistency ("indicating" → "consistent with")
5. Added Murphy (1993) to references
6. Updated iteration status to 7

### Deliberation and changelog written to docs/exchanges/researcher_response.md
