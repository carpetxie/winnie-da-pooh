The paper grew from 271 to 278 lines — modest growth for meaningful additions. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Summary of Iteration 7 Changes

**Four changes made to `docs/findings.md`:**

1. **Snapshot Sensitivity section (Big Thing)**: Added hedging paragraph explicitly noting per-timepoint CRPS/MAE ratios are point estimates without CIs, the U-shaped maturity pattern is "suggestive" not confirmed, and traders should treat it as "directionally informative rather than statistically confirmed." This restores consistency with the paper's otherwise rigorous uncertainty quantification.

2. **U-shape mechanistic interpretation (Should Fix 1)**: Replaced the vague "haven't converged" explanation with a three-phase hypothesis (labeled speculative): prior inheritance at early life → partial-signal overreaction at mid-life → convergence pressure at late life. Includes a testable prediction that simpler-signal series should show less mid-life degradation.

3. **Mechanism 1 caveat (Should Fix 2)**: Added paragraph noting the tension between the release-frequency hypothesis and the early CPI calibration result (CRPS/MAE=0.76 at 10%). Argues this favors signal dimensionality (mechanism 2) as the primary driver, while frequency may operate as a secondary factor.

4. **Section 2→3 transition (Should Fix 3)**: Added two-sentence bridge connecting distributional calibration quality to information flow analysis.

**One pushback**: Declined to add maturity-conditional language to the trader box — the current blanket "ignore CPI distributional spread" is more conservative and appropriate given the very point-estimate concerns the reviewer raised.

**Full deliberation written to `docs/exchanges/researcher_response.md`.**
