Done. Here's what happened:

**Critique summary:** The reviewer issued a clean **ACCEPT** with zero new action items. All five polish changes from iteration 1 were confirmed as correctly implemented. The reviewer's verdict: "Publish as-is."

**Changes made:**
1. **Status line updated** — Changed from iteration-tracking ("Post PhD-review, iteration 7...") to acceptance status ("Accepted for publication. PhD-review complete (2 iterations, ACCEPT).")

**No other changes.** The paper has no remaining must-fix or should-fix items. The reviewer explicitly stated "Further iteration would produce zero marginal value." I performed a full editorial read-through and found no typos, inconsistencies, or improvements to make.

The response is written to `docs/exchanges/researcher_response.md` with STATUS: CONTINUE (as instructed not to set CONVERGED), though both the reviewer and I agree the paper is ready to publish.
