Both files look good. Here's a summary of what I did:

## Summary of Iteration 1

**Critique received:** The reviewer identified two must-fix issues and four should-fix items. The paper's central framing (CRPS ≤ MAE as a mathematical bound) was incorrect, and the SPX no-arbitrage comparison had an unacknowledged granularity mismatch.

**Changes made to `docs/findings.md`:**
1. **Fixed CRPS/MAE mathematical framing** (Section 2) — Rewrote from "CRPS is always ≤ MAE" (incorrect) to framing ratio > 1 as a diagnostic signal of miscalibration, with explicit note that this is not a mathematical bound
2. **Added no-arbitrage granularity caveat** (Abstract + Section 1) — Changed "comparable" to "directionally comparable," added caveat about hourly vs daily sampling mismatch
3. **Added strike structure reporting** (Section 2) — New paragraph documenting CPI avg 2.3 strikes vs Jobless Claims avg 2.8, with assessment that the confound is real but insufficient to explain the full 32% penalty
4. **Added Hersbach (2000) reference** — CRPS decomposition cited as priority future work
5. **Strengthened SPF caveat** — Added explicit footnote explaining the annual/12 conversion's limitations
6. **Connected PIT to CRPS/MAE** — New paragraph linking mean PIT=0.61 to the CRPS/MAE > 1 finding as corroborating evidence of directional miscalibration

**Pushback:** Declined to implement CRPS quantile decomposition — with only 2–3 strikes per CPI event, the analysis would be misleading.

**Full deliberation written to `docs/exchanges/researcher_response.md`.**
