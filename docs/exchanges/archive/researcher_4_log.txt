Here's a summary of what I did in iteration 4:

## Iteration 4 Summary

### Code Changes
1. **experiment13/run.py** — Added interior-only Mann-Whitney U test as a robustness check for the heterogeneity test (resolves the must-fix: **p=0.026, r=−0.48**, confirming heterogeneity is robust across both metric specifications)
2. **experiment13/run.py** — Added mean-of-ratios computation showing CPI=3.89 (tail-aware) vs ratio-of-means=1.58, dramatically illustrating why the aggregation method matters
3. **experiment13/run.py** — Cleaned up dead Hersbach CRPS decomposition stub (replaced ~25 lines of dead code including `pass` loop body with 3-line explanatory comment)

### Paper Changes (docs/findings.md)
1. **Abstract restructured** — Now leads with the point-vs-distribution decoupling insight ("accurate point forecasts + harmful distributions"), the paper's most actionable finding for traders
2. **Practical Takeaways box** — Replaced prose "Bottom line" with 3 bullet-pointed action items (use JC distributions, use CPI point forecast only, monitor CRPS/MAE ratio)
3. **Interior-only MWU** added to heterogeneity paragraph — confirms p=0.026 (interior) alongside p=0.003 (tail-aware)
4. **KXJOBLESSCLAIMS-26JAN29 example** — Concrete illustration of ratio instability (10.36 tail-aware vs 1.20 interior)
5. **Ratio-of-means vs mean-of-ratios comparison table** — Shows tail-aware mean-of-ratios inflates CPI to 3.89 and JC to 1.29
6. **Strengthened random walk language** — "Significant at the 10% level with adequate power (>80%)" instead of "borderline significant"
7. **Point-vs-distribution decoupling** elevated to co-headline finding with dedicated paragraph in Section 3
8. **Monte Carlo simulation** compressed for readability

### New Numbers
- Interior-only Mann-Whitney: **p=0.026, r=−0.48**
- Mean-of-ratios (CPI tail-aware): **3.89** (vs ratio-of-means 1.58)
- Mean-of-ratios (JC tail-aware): **1.29** (vs ratio-of-means 0.66)
