Here's a summary of what I did in iteration 4:

**Key changes to `docs/findings.md`:**

1. **Added worked economic example (Section 2)** — The biggest change. Two contrasting events make the CRPS/MAE ratio concrete for traders:
   - *Jobless Claims*: Distribution assigned 54% to the lower tail where the outcome landed, yielding CRPS nearly 2x better than point forecast alone. A "Below 215K" range contract would be priced correctly by the distribution but missed by the point forecast.
   - *CPI*: With only 2 strikes, the distribution actively hurt — ratio of 1.82 on that event.

2. **Added market design implications paragraph** — Connects the diagnostic to actionable levers for Kalshi: more CPI strikes, liquidity incentives at tails, and using CRPS/MAE as a real-time quality metric.

3. **Fixed the "41 events" arithmetic** — Changed from "(14 CPI, 16 Jobless Claims, 8 other)" to "(14 CPI, 24 Jobless Claims, 3 GDP)" with a note explaining why CRPS analysis uses n=16 Jobless Claims (realized outcomes subset).

4. **Softened B-L citation** — "following the logic of Breeden-Litzenberger" with a parenthetical explaining why binary contracts make extraction trivial vs. equity options.

5. **Renamed Section 3** — From "Context: Information Hierarchy..." to "Information Hierarchy: Bond Markets Lead, Prediction Markets Add Granularity."

**Pushback:** Declined to restructure the trader callout box — it already leads with the strong result.

Full deliberation is in `docs/exchanges/researcher_response.md`.
