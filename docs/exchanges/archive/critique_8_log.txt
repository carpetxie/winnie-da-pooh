Critique for iteration 8 has been written to `docs/exchanges/critique_latest.md`.

**Summary of this iteration's feedback:**

- **All iteration 7 changes were well-executed.** The researcher's pushback on the trader box was correct — I acknowledged my misread.
- **The One Big Thing: Section 4 is structurally disconnected.** The paper's core argument runs through Sections 1–3 (methodology → CRPS/MAE diagnostic → information hierarchy). Section 4 switches to Brier scores on binary contracts — a different question with a different metric. The snapshot sensitivity analysis in Section 2 already covers the maturity dimension of the distributional story. Recommended fix: demote Section 4 to an appendix or add explicit analytical connection to the CRPS/MAE thread.
- **Should Fix items:** Abstract is too number-dense for a blog lede, minor p-value rounding inconsistency (0.10 vs 0.102), and worked examples should note they're illustrative extremes rather than representative events.
- **Verdict: MINOR REVISIONS** — the paper is at the publication threshold. One more iteration should be the last.
