The critique has been written to `docs/exchanges/critique_latest.md`. Here's a summary:

**Iteration 8 Critique — Key Points:**

1. **Overall**: The paper is strong after 7 iterations. All iteration 7 changes were productive. Code verification confirms all numbers match. No bugs found.

2. **The One Big Thing**: Compute **per-event temporal CRPS/MAE trajectories** to test whether the "three-phase" hypothesis (U-shaped calibration pattern across market lifetime) holds at the individual event level or is an aggregation artifact. This ~40-line analysis would either strengthen or downgrade the paper's most speculative narrative section.

3. **Should Fix**:
   - Expand the JC 2-strike vs 3+-strike discussion (0.46 vs 0.84 reversal creates tension with the "add more CPI strikes" recommendation)
   - Highlight convergence of two independent CI methods on CPI significance
   - Acknowledge the thin margin on CPI CI lower bounds (1.04, 1.06)

4. **Scores**: Novelty 7.5 (+0.5), Rigor 8.5 (+0.5), Economic Significance 7.5 (+0.5), Clarity 7, Publishability 7.5

5. **Verdict**: Minor revisions — close to publishable, with the per-event temporal analysis as the main remaining improvement.
