## Iteration 8 Critique Summary

**Verdict: MINOR REVISIONS** (close to publication-ready)

### Key Points:

1. **Data Sufficiency**: Unchanged at 8/10 — the 11-series, 248-event dataset is adequate. Not raising data expansion.

2. **The One Big Thing**: **Formalize the overconcentration test.** The paper's most universal finding (all 11 series have std(PIT) < 0.289) is now elevated to the abstract but lacks a formal statistical test. A binomial sign test (p ≈ 0.0005) and pooled bootstrap CI are ~15 lines of code.

3. **Must Fix**: Only one item — add the formal overconcentration test (sign test + pooled bootstrap CI on std(PIT)).

4. **Should Fix** (4 items):
   - Clarify KXFRM monitoring alerts (10/52 = 19% alert rate needs defense)
   - Connect strike-count Monte Carlo to overconcentration defense
   - Clarify which point forecast (interior vs tail-aware) generates the executive summary MAE
   - Compute std(PIT) vs CRPS/MAE correlation across 11 series

5. **Code Review**: Deep review of experiment13 found the core methodology sound. Minor issues: bootstrap fallback inconsistency, unused variable, interior-only vs tail-aware conceptual mismatch. None are publication-blocking.

6. **All iteration 7 feedback was fully addressed** — no circular feedback.
