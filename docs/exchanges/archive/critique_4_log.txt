**Iteration 4 Critique — MAJOR REVISIONS**

### Top Priority: Data Expansion (Still)
The researcher committed in iteration 3 to fetching KXU3 (49 events), KXCPICORE (44 events), KXFRM (86 events), and KXCPIYOY (39 events) — totaling 218+ additional events that would more than double the dataset. This was not done. The script infrastructure exists; it's a matter of updating a target list and fixing the API path.

### New Issue Found: Reproducibility Gap
- KXADP and KXISMPMI candle files are **empty** (2 bytes each), yet results exist
- The results files have different field names than `fetch_new_series.py` would produce, suggesting they were generated by unknown code
- No `n_snapshots` field in results — can't verify mid-life snapshots were used
- `fetch_new_series.py` line 59 still uses the wrong API path (`/markets/{ticker}/candlesticks` instead of the series-prefixed path)

### What's Working Well
- BCa bootstrap fix properly executed
- Simple-vs-complex dichotomy (p=0.0004) is a genuine, novel finding
- 30 statistical corrections transparently documented
- The conceptual framework is strong and publishable

### Three Must-Fix Items
1. Fetch the 4 remaining series (218+ events)
2. Fix KXADP/KXISMPMI reproducibility (re-fetch candles, verify mid-life snapshots)
3. Fix the candlestick API path in `fetch_new_series.py`
