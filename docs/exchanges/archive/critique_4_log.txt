The iteration 4 critique has been written to `docs/exchanges/critique_latest.md`. Here's a summary:

**Verdict: MINOR REVISIONS** (scores up: Rigor 8/10, Publishability 8/10)

**Key findings this iteration:**

1. **The paper has improved significantly** — iteration 3's CPI LOO (all 14 ratios > 1.0) and formal heterogeneity test (permutation p<0.001, MWU p=0.003) were exactly the right additions.

2. **One must-fix item**: The Mann-Whitney heterogeneity test uses tail-aware per-event ratios, which the paper elsewhere identifies as unstable (e.g., KXJOBLESSCLAIMS-26JAN29 has a tail-aware ratio of 10.36 due to near-zero MAE). An interior-only Mann-Whitney should be run as a robustness check — a 5-line code change.

3. **The biggest opportunity**: The paper's most interesting finding — that CPI *point forecasts* beat all benchmarks while CPI *distributions* are harmful — is buried as a subsidiary observation. This decoupling is the directly actionable insight for traders and should be a co-headline.

4. **Narrative compression needed** for blog format: dual-metric reporting creates cognitive load, the abstract is long, and the Monte Carlo simulation details could move to an appendix.

5. **All previous must-fix items verified as resolved**: worked example corrected, serial correlation CI prose fixed, horse race uses tail-aware, temporal tables show both specifications.
