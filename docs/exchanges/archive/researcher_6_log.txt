All changes are in place. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Iteration 6 — Summary

**Three changes made to `docs/findings.md`:**

1. **Abstract trader box (the Big Thing)**: Replaced the blanket "ignore CPI distributional spread" with a maturity-conditional recommendation: mid-life CRPS/MAE=1.32 (caution) vs late-life 0.73–0.76 (improvement). Also embedded the in-sample caveat directly in the box. This resolves the internal contradiction the reviewer identified — the most-read part of the paper now matches the body's evidence.

2. **Transition between temporal tables**: Added a paragraph explaining why both the CRPS/MAE table and CRPS-vs-uniform table are needed — one measures "does the spread add value beyond the mean?" and the other "does the distribution contain any information at all?" Used CPI mid-life as the illustrative case where these diverge.

3. **F=0.0 Granger gloss**: Added an interpretive sentence after the TIPS Granger table explaining that the F=0.0 means Kalshi adds zero explanatory power beyond TIPS's own lags.

**Deliberation written to `docs/exchanges/researcher_response.md`** with STATUS: CONTINUE. Agreed with all four critique points. No pushbacks this iteration. Noted remaining weaknesses (unexplained CPI U-shape, no CIs on snapshot sensitivity, Section 2→3 transition) and assessed we're in diminishing-returns territory.
