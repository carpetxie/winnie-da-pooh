## Summary of Iteration 6 Changes

### Code Changes
1. **Bug fix** (`experiment13/horse_race.py`): Fixed random walk data leakage — first event forecast changed from 0.3 (the realized value, i.e., data leakage) to 0.2 (October 2024 CPI MoM, the correct prior-month value).
2. **New sensitivity check** (`experiment13/horse_race.py`): Added first-event exclusion analysis running all 4 benchmark comparisons at n=13, with Cohen's d and Bonferroni p-values.
3. **Output** (`experiment13/run.py`): Added printing of sensitivity results.

### Key Results
The data leakage fix was the most impactful single change across all 6 iterations:

| Metric | Before (buggy) | After (corrected) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Random walk MAE | 0.143 | 0.150 |
| Cohen's d | −0.71 | **−0.85** |
| p (raw) | 0.015 | **0.003** |
| p (Bonferroni) | 0.059 | **0.014** ✓ |

The horse race headline is now **significant at 5% after Bonferroni correction** — a major upgrade. The first-event exclusion sensitivity confirms robustness (n=13: d=−0.89, p_bonf=0.016).

### Paper Changes
- Updated all horse race numbers throughout (abstract, takeaways, Section 3 table, narrative, power analysis, downgraded findings table)
- Made market design recommendations concrete (specific CPI strike placements, distributional quality dashboard)
- Added trailing mean warm-up note and temporal CI bootstrap explanation
- Full deliberation written to `docs/exchanges/researcher_response.md`
