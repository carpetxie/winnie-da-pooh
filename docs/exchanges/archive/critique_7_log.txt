The critique has been written to `docs/exchanges/critique_latest.md`. Here's a summary of the iteration 7 critique:

**Overall**: The paper is in strong shape after the data leakage fix. No remaining blockers.

**Key findings this iteration:**

1. **The One Big Thing**: Add a CRPS/MAE vs surprise magnitude analysis (~10 lines of code). The per-event data shows CPI's worst CRPS/MAE ratios cluster at *low-surprise* events (MAE≈0.05), while the best ratios are at *high-surprise* events (MAE≈0.15-0.20). This inverse relationship, if confirmed via Spearman correlation, would importantly nuance the paper's recommendation — distributions may fail on "easy" events but succeed on hard ones.

2. **Should Fix**: The "first empirical demonstration" novelty claim should be scoped to "*in prediction markets*" since calibration-sharpness decoupling is known in meteorological forecasting (Hersbach 2000, which the paper cites).

3. **Should Fix**: The PIT claim oscillates between "suggestive" (PIT section) and "indicating" (Section 3 decoupling paragraph) — needs consistent hedging.

4. **New finding**: Per-event CRPS/MAE ratios have very low autocorrelation (CPI ρ=0.12, JC ρ=0.04), meaning the block bootstrap (targeting ρ=0.23) is conservative. Worth noting as it strengthens the CI results.

**Scores**: Methodology up to 8/10 (from 7), Blog Publishability up to 7.5/10. **Verdict: Minor Revisions.**
