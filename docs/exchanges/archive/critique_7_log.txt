Critique written to `docs/exchanges/critique_latest.md`. Here's the summary:

**Iteration 7 — MINOR REVISIONS**

The paper is in excellent shape after the researcher addressed all iteration 6 feedback. Scores improved across Economic Significance (7.5), Narrative Clarity (8), and Blog Publishability (8.5).

**The One Big Thing:** The maturity-conditional CPI recommendation in the trader box (the key fix from iteration 6) now rests on snapshot sensitivity point estimates *without confidence intervals*. At n=14, the 0.73 ratio at 75% of market life likely has a CI that includes 1.0 — just like the 1.32 at mid-life does. The paper is distinguishing "bad" from "good" timepoints when the CIs probably overlap. Fix: one hedging sentence acknowledging the per-timepoint ratios are suggestive, not statistically confirmed. This maintains the paper's hard-earned credibility for honest uncertainty quantification.

**Should Fix (3 items):**
1. Add 2–3 sentences explaining the CPI U-shape mechanistically (the researcher already has a hypothesis in their response — just put it in the paper)
2. Note the tension between the U-shape and the release-frequency hypothesis (mechanism 2 fits better than mechanism 1)
3. Add the Section 2→3 transition sentence the researcher already identified

**Verdict:** This should be the final substantive iteration. All remaining fixes are sentence-level additions, not methodological corrections.
