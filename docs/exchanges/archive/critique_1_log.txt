Critique written to `docs/exchanges/critique_latest.md`. Here's a summary of the key findings:

**Verdict: MINOR REVISIONS**

**The One Big Thing:** The paper's central claim — "CRPS is always ≤ MAE for any distribution" — is mathematically incorrect. CRPS can exceed MAE for miscalibrated distributions (which is exactly what happens for CPI). The ratio > 1 is a *diagnostic signal*, not a violation of a mathematical bound. This is a 2-sentence fix but it's in the conceptual foundation of the paper.

**Two Must-Fix items:**
1. Reframe the CRPS/MAE ratio as a calibration diagnostic rather than a mathematical inequality
2. Add a granularity caveat to the no-arbitrage SPX comparison (hourly Kalshi vs daily SPX aren't directly comparable)

**Four Should-Fix items:**
1. Report strike counts/spacing per series (potential CPI confound)
2. Cite Hersbach (2000) CRPS decomposition — preempts obvious critique from forecasting specialists
3. Strengthen the SPF "annual/12 proxy" caveat
4. Connect the PIT analysis (mean=0.61, suggesting inflation underestimation) to the CRPS/MAE > 1 finding in the main text

**Scores:** Novelty 7, Rigor 6, Economic Significance 7, Clarity 7, Publishability 6. All fixable to 7-8 range with the revisions above.
