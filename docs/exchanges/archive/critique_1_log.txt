Critique written to `docs/exchanges/critique_latest.md`.

**Summary:** The paper receives an **ACCEPT** verdict. Scores range from 7–8/10 across all criteria. The CRPS/MAE ratio diagnostic is genuinely useful (not trivial repackaging), the heterogeneity finding has concrete implications for Kalshi's market design, and the self-critical transparency (publishing negative findings, documenting invalidated results) would strongly enhance Kalshi's research credibility.

**The One Big Thing:** Add an explicit in-sample caveat — one sentence noting all results use the full dataset without hold-out validation. This is polish, not a blocker.

**No must-fix items.** Four minor "should fix" suggestions: SPX table frequency labels, Section 4 bridge sentence, mechanism 3 qualifier, and a CRPS tail decomposition note for future work. The paper is ready to publish.
