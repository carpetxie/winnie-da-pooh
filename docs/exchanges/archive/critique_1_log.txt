Critique written to `docs/exchanges/critique_latest.md`.

**Summary:** Iteration 2 — **ACCEPT**. All five polish items from the previous critique were implemented cleanly. Scores are 7-8/10 across all criteria (Narrative Clarity improved to 8/10 with the bridge sentence and frequency labels). No remaining must-fix or should-fix items. The paper has converged and is ready to publish on the Kalshi Research blog.
