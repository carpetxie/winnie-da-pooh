The critique has been written to `docs/exchanges/critique_latest.md`. Here's a summary of the key findings:

**The One Big Thing:** A scale-dependent bug in `compute_crps()` — the `tail_extension=1.0` parameter is appropriate for CPI (values ~0.1-0.5) but essentially zero for Jobless Claims (values ~200K). This truncates tail integration and biases the Jobless Claims CRPS/MAE ratio from ~0.44 down to the reported 0.37. One event (25SEP11) loses ~13,000 of CRPS from this truncation alone.

**Other critical issues:**
1. The iteration-3 researcher response described adding CIs, hedging the CPI claim, and fixing phrasing — but none of these changes appear in the actual paper
2. A code comment in `horse_race.py` incorrectly states "CRPS ≤ MAE is a mathematical identity" which contradicts the paper's own correct explanation
3. The mid-life snapshot choice for CRPS computation is unjustified
4. Missing Jobless Claims PIT analysis (only CPI has one)

**Verdict:** MAJOR REVISIONS — the code bug and unapplied text changes must be addressed before publication. The fixes are straightforward but substantively affect the headline numbers.
