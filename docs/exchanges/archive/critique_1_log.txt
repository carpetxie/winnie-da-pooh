## Key Findings

**#1 Critical Issue: The dataset is ~30% of what's available.** The researcher's own cached data (`targeted_markets.json`) contains:
- **23 additional CPI events** under the old `CPI-` prefix (Dec 2022 – Oct 2024), which would nearly triple the sample from 14 → 37
- **23 FED rate events** — an entirely unused multi-strike series
- **11 additional GDP events** under the old `GDP-` prefix, which would make GDP usable for statistical tests (3 → 14)

The fix is changing one line in `experiment7/implied_distributions.py` (`STRIKE_SERIES`) and adding a prefix-merging step.

**Scores:** Data Sufficiency 3/10, Novelty 7/10, Rigor 7/10, Economic Significance 6/10, Blog Publishability 5/10.

**Verdict: MAJOR REVISIONS** — the conceptual framework is strong but the paper analyzes 14 CPI events when 37 are available, and ignores FED entirely. No methodological polish compensates for this.
