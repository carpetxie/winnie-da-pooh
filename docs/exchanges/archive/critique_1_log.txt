I've written the critique to `docs/exchanges/critique_latest.md`. Here's a summary of the key points:

**Overall**: The paper has a genuinely novel diagnostic (CRPS/MAE ratio) and exceptional intellectual honesty, but has one critical methodological issue.

**The One Big Thing**: The implied mean computation excludes tail probability (only uses interior probability between min/max strikes). For CPI events with just 2 strikes, 40%+ of probability mass is ignored. This biases the MAE denominator of the CRPS/MAE ratio, potentially inflating the headline CPI number (1.32). The fix is straightforward — compute E[X] from the full piecewise-linear CDF used for CRPS.

**Key findings from code review**:
- 2-strike CPI events have CRPS/MAE ratio of 1.81 vs 1.69 for 3-strike events
- The CRPS computation correctly integrates over tails, but MAE uses the biased interior-only mean — creating an apples-to-oranges comparison
- JC finding (ratio=0.60, CI excludes 1.0) is robust and should be stated more strongly
- Granger causality language ("information hierarchy", "downstream") overinterprets the statistical test

**Scores**: Novelty 7/10, Rigor 5/10, Economic Significance 7/10, Clarity 8/10, Publishability 5/10

**Verdict**: Major revisions — fix the implied mean, add CRPS decomposition, strengthen the JC claim.
