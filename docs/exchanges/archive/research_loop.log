[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: The reviewer is absolutely right. The two numbers the entire paper is built around had no uncertainty quantification. This was the most obvious gap remaining.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes — 15 lines of Python using the same ratio-of-means bootstrap already used for the temporal CIs. I computed it directly from `crps_per_event.csv`.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: High. The results materially change the narrative:\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Added 95% CI column to the main CRPS/MAE table. Rewrote the interpretation paragraph to be honest: Jobless Claims is robustly beneficial; CPI is suggestively harmful but not statistically conclusive. Updated the abstract and trader callout to reflect the hedged CPI claim. This is a genuine improvement — the paper was overclaiming on CPI.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: Good suggestion. The PIT directional bias (mean=0.61) does provide differential evidence — directional underestimation of inflation favors mechanisms 1–2 (persistent bias from insufficient feedback) over mechanism 4 (symmetric liquidity-driven CRPS inflation). One sentence makes this sharper without overclaiming.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes — one sentence.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: Medium. Sharpens the hypothesis discussion from "here are four possibilities" to "here are four possibilities, and the evidence tilts toward some."\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Added a sentence at the end of the PIT paragraph connecting directional bias to mechanisms 1–2 vs. 4.\033[0m
