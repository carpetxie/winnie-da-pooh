Not methodologically novel (CRPS is standard), but the application to prediction markets and the per-series decomposition are new and useful. |\033[0m
[2026-02-21 21:59:02 +4m23s]     \033[0;36m| Methodological Rigor | 6/10 | — | The CRPS/MAE > 1 interpretation rests on an incorrect mathematical claim. The SPF conversion is crude. The no-arbitrage comparison mixes hourly vs daily granularity. Bonferroni, power analysis, and regime-appropriate benchmarks are all strengths, but the foundation has cracks. |\033[0m

[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: The reviewer is correct. There is no general theorem that CRPS ≤ MAE for arbitrary distributions. The property holds in expectation for well-calibrated distributions due to the sharpness reward term, but a miscalibrated distribution can absolutely produce CRPS > MAE — which is the entire diagnostic signal we rely on. Presenting it as a bound is wrong and would be caught by any forecasting specialist.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes — a reframing of ~3 sentences, no new analysis needed.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: High. This is the conceptual core of the paper.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Rewrote the CRPS/MAE introduction in Section 2 to frame ratio > 1 as a diagnostic signal of miscalibration rather than a violation of a mathematical bound. Added explicit parenthetical clarifying this is not a bound.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: Valid point. Hourly vs daily sampling granularity makes the comparison approximate. However, I note that the direction of the bias actually *favors Kalshi* — hourly sampling catches transient violations that would wash out at daily granularity, so Kalshi's true daily violation rate is likely lower than 2.8%.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes — one sentence caveat.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: Medium. Prevents justified criticism from quantitative readers.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Changed "comparable" to "directionally comparable" in both the abstract and Section 1 prose. Added explicit caveat noting the granularity mismatch and that it likely favors Kalshi.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]   \033[1;33mPushbacks: 1 points challenged\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[1;33m- **CRPS quantile decomposition "feasible now"**: Disagree. With 2–3 strikes per CPI event, decomposing CRPS into center vs tail contributions would produce meaningless numbers. The strike granularity is too coarse. I've acknowledged this as future work (via Hersbach decomposition) but decline to implement a misleading analysis. The reviewer's instinct is correct that this would be valuable — it's just not feasible with the current data resolution.\033[0m

[2026-02-21 22:11:09 +16m30s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: The reviewer is right that the qualitative argument ("~0.5 fewer strikes is unlikely to explain a 32% penalty") was the paper's weakest link. This is the central claim and it rested on unquantified intuition. A simulation makes it rigorous.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:11:09 +16m30s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes — 50 lines of Python. I ran a Monte Carlo (10,000 trials) with Normal distributions matched to each series' realized parameters, constructing piecewise-linear CDFs with 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 10 strikes.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:11:09 +16m30s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: High. This is the difference between "we think" and "we demonstrate."\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:11:09 +16m30s]     \033[0;36m- **Result**: Going from 3 to 2 strikes inflates CRPS by only 1–2%. The strike-count confound accounts for at most ~5% of the 32% CPI penalty. The finding is robust.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:11:09 +16m30s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Replaced the qualitative strike structure note with simulation results. Updated the abstract to mention the simulation. Script saved to `scripts/strike_count_simulation.py` for reproducibility.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:11:09 +16m30s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: The abstract was trying to be the paper in miniature. For a blog audience, the hook matters more than completeness.\033[0m
