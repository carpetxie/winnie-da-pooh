[2026-02-21 21:59:02 +4m23s]     \033[0;36m| Novelty | 7/10 | — | The per-series CRPS/MAE diagnostic and the heterogeneity finding are a genuine contribution. Not methodologically novel (CRPS is standard), but the application to prediction markets and the per-series decomposition are new and useful. |\033[0m
[2026-02-21 21:59:02 +4m23s]     \033[0;36m| Methodological Rigor | 6/10 | — | The CRPS/MAE > 1 interpretation rests on an incorrect mathematical claim. The SPF conversion is crude. The no-arbitrage comparison mixes hourly vs daily granularity. Bonferroni, power analysis, and regime-appropriate benchmarks are all strengths, but the foundation has cracks. |\033[0m
[2026-02-21 21:59:02 +4m23s]     \033[0;36m| Economic Significance | 7/10 | — | Actionable for both Kalshi (which series to invest in for distributional products) and traders (ignore CPI distributions, use Jobless Claims distributions). The information hierarchy finding (TIPS leads Kalshi) is useful context. |\033[0m
[2026-02-21 21:59:02 +4m23s]     \033[0;36m| Narrative Clarity | 7/10 | — | The paper tells a coherent story and the structure is logical. Section 4 (maturity) still feels slightly disconnected despite the bridge sentence. The transparency appendix is excellent. |\033[0m
[2026-02-21 21:59:02 +4m23s]     \033[0;36m| Blog Publishability | 6/10 | — | Close to publishable but the mathematical misstatement and the apples-to-oranges no-arbitrage comparison would draw justified criticism from quantitative readers. Fixing these is straightforward and would move this to 7-8. |\033[0m

[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]   \033[0;36mKey changes from response:\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: The reviewer is correct. There is no general theorem that CRPS ≤ MAE for arbitrary distributions. The property holds in expectation for well-calibrated distributions due to the sharpness reward term, but a miscalibrated distribution can absolutely produce CRPS > MAE — which is the entire diagnostic signal we rely on. Presenting it as a bound is wrong and would be caught by any forecasting specialist.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes — a reframing of ~3 sentences, no new analysis needed.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: High. This is the conceptual core of the paper.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Rewrote the CRPS/MAE introduction in Section 2 to frame ratio > 1 as a diagnostic signal of miscalibration rather than a violation of a mathematical bound. Added explicit parenthetical clarifying this is not a bound.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: Valid point. Hourly vs daily sampling granularity makes the comparison approximate. However, I note that the direction of the bias actually *favors Kalshi* — hourly sampling catches transient violations that would wash out at daily granularity, so Kalshi's true daily violation rate is likely lower than 2.8%.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes — one sentence caveat.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: Medium. Prevents justified criticism from quantitative readers.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Changed "comparable" to "directionally comparable" in both the abstract and Section 1 prose. Added explicit caveat noting the granularity mismatch and that it likely favors Kalshi.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]   \033[1;33mPushbacks: 1 points challenged\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:03:39 +9m0s]     \033[1;33m- **CRPS quantile decomposition "feasible now"**: Disagree. With 2–3 strikes per CPI event, decomposing CRPS into center vs tail contributions would produce meaningless numbers. The strike granularity is too coarse. I've acknowledged this as future work (via Hersbach decomposition) but decline to implement a misleading analysis. The reviewer's instinct is correct that this would be valuable — it's just not feasible with the current data resolution.\033[0m
