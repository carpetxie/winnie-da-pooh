[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: The reviewer is absolutely right. The two numbers the entire paper is built around had no uncertainty quantification. This was the most obvious gap remaining.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes — 15 lines of Python using the same ratio-of-means bootstrap already used for the temporal CIs. I computed it directly from `crps_per_event.csv`.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: High. The results materially change the narrative:\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Added 95% CI column to the main CRPS/MAE table. Rewrote the interpretation paragraph to be honest: Jobless Claims is robustly beneficial; CPI is suggestively harmful but not statistically conclusive. Updated the abstract and trader callout to reflect the hedged CPI claim. This is a genuine improvement — the paper was overclaiming on CPI.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: Good suggestion. The PIT directional bias (mean=0.61) does provide differential evidence — directional underestimation of inflation favors mechanisms 1–2 (persistent bias from insufficient feedback) over mechanism 4 (symmetric liquidity-driven CRPS inflation). One sentence makes this sharper without overclaiming.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes — one sentence.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: Medium. Sharpens the hypothesis discussion from "here are four possibilities" to "here are four possibilities, and the evidence tilts toward some."\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Added a sentence at the end of the PIT paragraph connecting directional bias to mechanisms 1–2 vs. 4.\033[0m

[2026-02-21 22:26:44 +32m5s]     \033[0;36m- **Small sample sizes**: n=14–16 remains the fundamental constraint. No revision can fix this.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:26:44 +32m5s]     \033[0;36m- **Two-series comparison**: The frequency hypothesis is suggestive but untestable with only CPI and Jobless Claims. Need PCE, mortgage applications, etc.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:26:44 +32m5s]     \033[0;36m- **In-sample evaluation**: All results are in-sample. Acknowledged but unfixable at current n.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:26:44 +32m5s]     \033[0;36m- **CPI strike coarseness**: 2–3 strikes is barely a "distribution." The Monte Carlo addresses mechanical inflation, but the philosophical question of what distributional information means with 2 strikes remains.\033[0m

[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]   \033[0;36mKey changes from response:\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: Fully agree. The reviewer correctly identified that `tail_extension=1.0` is scale-inappropriate for Jobless Claims (200K+ scale). The integration domain was effectively `[199999, 250001]`, truncating CRPS for realized values outside this range.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes, straightforward fix.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: HIGH. This was the most consequential change. The fix changed the headline number more than the reviewer predicted:\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Fixed `compute_crps()` to use scale-appropriate tail extension: `max(strike_range * 0.5, 1.0)`. Also added coverage of realized values beyond strike boundaries (`x_min = min(strikes[0] - ext, realized - ext)`). Updated all numbers throughout the paper. Added this correction to the Downgraded findings table in Appendix C.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]     \033[0;36m- **Partially disagree**: The reviewer states "the abstract still says 'actively harmful' for CPI without hedging, the CRPS/MAE table lacks a CI column, and the trader callout still says '63% more information.'" However, examining the paper as it stood:\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: LOW. The iteration-3 changes were already applied. The reviewer appears to have been comparing against a stale version.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: No additional changes needed for this point. The hedging language, CIs, and corrected phrasing were already present. (The numbers have now changed due to the tail-extension fix, so I updated 63% → 40% and all CI values.)\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: The comment says "CRPS <= MAE is a mathematical identity for any proper distribution" which is false. CRPS <= MAE holds for well-calibrated distributions, not all distributions.\033[0m
