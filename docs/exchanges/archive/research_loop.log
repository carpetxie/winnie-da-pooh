[2026-02-22 01:19:41 +126m46s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: Strongly. The reviewer correctly identifies the CRPS/MAE ratio has a mechanical denominator effect — high-surprise events have larger MAE denominators by construction. The paper overstated this by calling it "the paper's most actionable finding for traders."\033[0m
[2026-02-22 01:19:41 +126m46s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes — the code already computes uniform_crps; I just needed to split it by surprise subsets.\033[0m
[2026-02-22 01:19:41 +126m46s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: **HIGH** — This is the most important analytical fix of the iteration. The CRPS/uniform ratio is mechanically independent of surprise magnitude and provides a clean check.\033[0m
[2026-02-22 01:19:41 +126m46s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Implemented CRPS/uniform computation for surprise subsets. Results:\033[0m
[2026-02-22 01:19:41 +126m46s]     \033[0;36m- **Key nuance**: Even with the genuine signal confirmed, CPI high-surprise CRPS/uniform=1.42 still exceeds 1.0 — distributions are still worse than uniform. The improvement is relative (much less harmful), not absolute (not actually good). This is honestly reported.\033[0m
[2026-02-22 01:19:41 +126m46s]     \033[0;36m- **Code written**: Yes — ~15 lines added to Phase 7E in experiment13/run.py.\033[0m
[2026-02-22 01:19:41 +126m46s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: Good catch. The old code used different median splits for tail-aware vs interior-only, meaning different events in the "high" and "low" groups.\033[0m
