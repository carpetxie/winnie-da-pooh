[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: The reviewer is absolutely right. The two numbers the entire paper is built around had no uncertainty quantification. This was the most obvious gap remaining.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes — 15 lines of Python using the same ratio-of-means bootstrap already used for the temporal CIs. I computed it directly from `crps_per_event.csv`.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: High. The results materially change the narrative:\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Added 95% CI column to the main CRPS/MAE table. Rewrote the interpretation paragraph to be honest: Jobless Claims is robustly beneficial; CPI is suggestively harmful but not statistically conclusive. Updated the abstract and trader callout to reflect the hedged CPI claim. This is a genuine improvement — the paper was overclaiming on CPI.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: Good suggestion. The PIT directional bias (mean=0.61) does provide differential evidence — directional underestimation of inflation favors mechanisms 1–2 (persistent bias from insufficient feedback) over mechanism 4 (symmetric liquidity-driven CRPS inflation). One sentence makes this sharper without overclaiming.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes — one sentence.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: Medium. Sharpens the hypothesis discussion from "here are four possibilities" to "here are four possibilities, and the evidence tilts toward some."\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:17:47 +23m8s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Added a sentence at the end of the PIT paragraph connecting directional bias to mechanisms 1–2 vs. 4.\033[0m

[2026-02-21 22:26:44 +32m5s]     \033[0;36m- **Two-series comparison**: The frequency hypothesis is suggestive but untestable with only CPI and Jobless Claims. Need PCE, mortgage applications, etc.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:26:44 +32m5s]     \033[0;36m- **In-sample evaluation**: All results are in-sample. Acknowledged but unfixable at current n.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:26:44 +32m5s]     \033[0;36m- **CPI strike coarseness**: 2–3 strikes is barely a "distribution." The Monte Carlo addresses mechanical inflation, but the philosophical question of what distributional information means with 2 strikes remains.\033[0m

[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]   \033[0;36mKey changes from response:\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: Fully agree. The reviewer correctly identified that `tail_extension=1.0` is scale-inappropriate for Jobless Claims (200K+ scale). The integration domain was effectively `[199999, 250001]`, truncating CRPS for realized values outside this range.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes, straightforward fix.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: HIGH. This was the most consequential change. The fix changed the headline number more than the reviewer predicted:\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Fixed `compute_crps()` to use scale-appropriate tail extension: `max(strike_range * 0.5, 1.0)`. Also added coverage of realized values beyond strike boundaries (`x_min = min(strikes[0] - ext, realized - ext)`). Updated all numbers throughout the paper. Added this correction to the Downgraded findings table in Appendix C.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]     \033[0;36m- **Partially disagree**: The reviewer states "the abstract still says 'actively harmful' for CPI without hedging, the CRPS/MAE table lacks a CI column, and the trader callout still says '63% more information.'" However, examining the paper as it stood:\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: LOW. The iteration-3 changes were already applied. The reviewer appears to have been comparing against a stale version.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: No additional changes needed for this point. The hedging language, CIs, and corrected phrasing were already present. (The numbers have now changed due to the tail-extension fix, so I updated 63% → 40% and all CI values.)\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:29:45 +13m48s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: The comment says "CRPS <= MAE is a mathematical identity for any proper distribution" which is false. CRPS <= MAE holds for well-calibrated distributions, not all distributions.\033[0m

[2026-02-21 22:32:52 +38m13s]     \033[0;36m- **CPI "distributions" from 2 strikes**: Philosophically thin. Monte Carlo bounds the mechanical effect but can't address the conceptual question.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:32:52 +38m13s]     \033[0;36m- **Worked examples are illustrative**: The two events are representative but hand-selected. A systematic event-level analysis would be stronger but risks overcomplicating presentation.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:32:52 +38m13s]     \033[0;36m- **No BCa intervals**: The reviewer suggested BCa as an alternative robustness check.

[2026-02-21 22:37:23 +42m44s]     \033[0;36m- **The CPI U-shaped pattern (well-calibrated early/late, miscalibrated mid-life) is descriptive but unexplained mechanistically.** The paper says "markets have incorporated some information but not yet converged" — this is hand-wavy. A possible mechanism: early markets inherit the prior from strike structure (happens to be reasonable); mid-life markets overreact to partial signals; late markets converge as the release date forces information integration. But this is speculative and untestable with current data.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:37:23 +42m44s]     \033[0;36m- **No CIs on snapshot sensitivity ratios.** The snapshot table reports point estimates at each timepoint but no confidence intervals. Individual event-level scatter at each timepoint could be large. Adding per-timepoint bootstraps would require re-running experiment 13.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:37:23 +42m44s]     \033[0;36m- **The Section 2→3 transition remains somewhat abrupt.** We go from distributional calibration to information hierarchy without a strong narrative bridge. A one-sentence connector ("Having established *how well* Kalshi prices distributions, we now ask *where the information comes from*") could help.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:37:23 +42m44s]     \033[0;36m- **Small sample sizes remain the binding constraint** on all inference. Honestly characterized throughout but fundamentally unfixable without more data.\033[0m

[2026-02-21 22:43:37 +48m58s]   \033[0;36mKey changes from response:\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:43:37 +48m58s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: The reviewer is right that per-timepoint ratios are point estimates and at n=14, CIs would include 1.0 at most timepoints. The paper's credibility rests on honest uncertainty quantification, so the snapshot sensitivity section should be held to the same standard.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:43:37 +48m58s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes — this is a prose addition, not new analysis.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:43:37 +48m58s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: Medium-high. It's a consistency-of-standards issue. The paper correctly CIs everything else; leaving the maturity pattern unhedged is an oversight.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:43:37 +48m58s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Added a hedging paragraph after the snapshot sensitivity interpretation, explicitly noting that per-timepoint ratios are point estimates, individual CIs would likely include 1.0, and the U-shaped pattern is "suggestive and consistent with an information-incorporation process, but requires confirmation with larger samples." Also updated the practical implication sentence to say "directionally informative rather than statistically confirmed."\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:43:37 +48m58s]     \033[0;36m- **Note on the trader box**: The critique references maturity-conditional language in the trader box ("treat mid-life distributional spread with caution... but note that late-life distributions show improvement"), but the current trader box actually gives a blanket "ignore CPI distributional spread" recommendation — it doesn't make the maturity-conditional claim. I kept the trader box as-is (blanket recommendation) since the hedged snapshot sensitivity section already provides the nuance for readers who want maturity-conditional guidance, and putting unconfirmed maturity patterns in the trader box would be the exact overreach the reviewer is warning against.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:43:37 +48m58s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: The three-phase hypothesis (prior inheritance → partial-signal overreaction → convergence) is genuinely explanatory and was missing from the paper. The current text only explained mid-life; it didn't explain why early distributions are also well-calibrated.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:43:37 +48m58s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes — prose addition, clearly labeled as speculative.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:43:37 +48m58s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: Medium-high. Transforms an unexplained pattern into an interpretable one with a testable prediction.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:43:37 +48m58s]   \033[1;33mPushbacks: 1 points challenged\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:43:37 +48m58s]     \033[1;33m- **Trader box maturity-conditional language**: The critique assumes the trader box makes a maturity-conditional recommendation, but the current trader box gives a blanket "ignore CPI distributional spread" recommendation — which is actually the more conservative and appropriate framing given that we've just established the per-timepoint ratios lack CIs. I declined to add maturity-conditional language to the trader box precisely because the snapshot sensitivity CIs would not support it. The nuance lives in the body text where readers can assess it with full context. This is a case where the reviewer's concern is valid (point estimates need hedging) but the specific fix they envision (hedging a trader-box claim) doesn't apply because the trader box doesn't make that claim.\033[0m

[2026-02-21 22:47:17 +31m20s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree with reviewer's instinct**: The snapshot sensitivity table was doing load-bearing work without CIs. Even though the hedging sentence was there, computing the actual CIs is strictly better.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:47:17 +31m20s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes — added bootstrap CI computation to Phase 5 of experiment13/run.py.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:47:17 +31m20s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: HIGH. The results are genuinely informative and change the narrative in important ways:\033[0m

[2026-02-21 22:47:17 +31m20s]     \033[0;36m- **Table formatting**: Updated snapshot sensitivity table to include CI columns with bold entries where CIs exclude 1.0.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:47:17 +31m20s]     \033[0;36m- **Narrative update**: Rewrote the snapshot sensitivity interpretation to discuss the CIs rather than hedging about their absence. Separated CPI and JC interpretations since they tell different stories.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:47:17 +31m20s]     \033[0;36m- **Trader box**: The critique (from Iteration 7) references maturity-conditional language in the trader box. The current trader box gives a blanket "ignore CPI distributional spread" recommendation. Given that the per-timepoint CIs now confirm CPI CIs include 1.0 at 4 of 5 timepoints, the blanket recommendation is the right call — the data doesn't support maturity-conditional guidance for CPI.

[2026-02-21 22:48:50 +54m11s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: The reviewer is right. Section 4 uses Brier scores on individual binary contracts — a fundamentally different question (single-contract calibration) from the paper's through-line (distributional quality via CRPS/MAE). The opening sentence asserting a connection ("complements the series-level calibration heterogeneity") was hand-waving; there's no analytical link between the Brier-score maturity gradient and the CRPS/MAE diagnostic. Moreover, Section 2's snapshot sensitivity analysis already covers the maturity dimension *for the distributional story*, making Section 4 redundant along that axis.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:48:50 +54m11s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes. Option (a) — demoting to appendix — is clean and preserves the content for interested readers without disrupting the argument flow. Option (b) — connecting analytically — is not feasible because I don't have data linking per-contract Brier-score gradients to per-event CRPS/MAE ratios across maturity bins.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:48:50 +54m11s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: High for blog readability. The paper goes from four body sections (with a jarring metric switch at Section 4) to three tightly focused sections: methodology → CRPS/MAE diagnostic → information hierarchy. A blog reader following the distributional-value thread now gets a clean arc.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:48:50 +54m11s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Demoted Section 4 to Appendix D ("Market Maturity and Binary Contract Calibration") with a framing sentence connecting it to Section 2 while clarifying it addresses a different question (binary contract Brier scores, not distributional CRPS/MAE). Added a one-sentence forward pointer from Section 2's snapshot sensitivity discussion to Appendix D. Updated the Experiments Summary table.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:48:50 +54m11s]     \033[0;36m- **Agree**: The abstract was a wall of numbers with CIs — appropriate for a journal but wrong for a blog. Splitting into (i) the question + headline finding and (ii) supporting evidence makes it scannable. I also took the opportunity to bring the TIPS Granger result into the abstract (previously absent), which rounds out the information-hierarchy piece.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:48:50 +54m11s]     \033[0;36m- **Feasible**: Yes — prose restructuring only.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:48:50 +54m11s]     \033[0;36m- **Impact**: Medium-high. The abstract is the first thing a blog reader sees; a number-dense paragraph is a bounce risk.\033[0m
[2026-02-21 22:48:50 +54m11s]     \033[0;36m- **Action**: Split the abstract into two paragraphs. First paragraph: question, CRPS/MAE diagnostic, heterogeneity, maturity pattern. Second paragraph: PIT, horse race, TIPS, power. Thinned the CI detail (moved full CIs to the main tables where they belong; abstract now says "CI excludes 1.0" / "CI includes 1.0" which conveys the same information more accessibly).\033[0m

[2026-02-21 22:48:50 +54m11s]     \033[1;33m- None this iteration. All four critique points are valid, feasible, and improve the paper. The reviewer correctly identified that the structural issue (Section 4 disconnection) was the most impactful remaining problem, and the organizational fix is clean. The reviewer also correctly noted this should be near-final — the remaining changes are presentational, not analytical.\033[0m
