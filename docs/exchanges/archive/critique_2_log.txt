Critique written to `docs/exchanges/critique_latest.md`. Here's a summary:

**Iteration 2 — MINOR REVISIONS**

The paper is materially improved from iteration 1. All prior must-fix items (CRPS/MAE mathematical framing, no-arbitrage granularity caveat) are resolved. The strike structure reporting, SPF caveat, PIT→CRPS narrative connection, and Hersbach reference all landed well.

**The One Big Thing remaining:** Quantify the strike-count confound with a simple Monte Carlo simulation. The paper argues qualitatively that ~0.5 fewer CPI strikes "probably can't explain a 32% penalty," but this is the core claim and deserves numerical evidence. A 30-50 line simulation would either confirm the finding's robustness or reveal it's partly a measurement artifact.

**Scores:** Novelty 7, Rigor 7 (+1), Economic Significance 7, Narrative Clarity 8 (+1), Blog Publishability 7 (+1).

I dropped the CRPS quantile decomposition suggestion — the researcher's pushback was correct (infeasible with 2-3 strikes). Should-fix items include tightening the abstract, adding CIs to the temporal evolution table, and sharpening the format for a blog audience. Expecting one more iteration to convergence.
