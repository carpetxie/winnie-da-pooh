## Iteration 6 Critique Summary

**Verdict: MINOR REVISIONS** (upgraded from Major Revisions in iteration 5)

**Scores:** All 7/10 (up +1 to +3 from iteration 5)

The researcher addressed all 8 points from iteration 5 — incorporating all 11 series, rewriting the simple-vs-complex thesis honestly, and reframing the paper around the stronger finding ("9/11 series add value"). The paper is now fundamentally sound.

**Two Must-Fix items remain:**
1. **Extend PIT analysis to all 11 series** — the paper is a "distributional calibration" study that validates calibration for only 4/11 series (36%). The code infrastructure exists; it requires changing one hard-coded list in experiment13/run.py.
2. **Add one sentence addressing the "good point forecast inflates ratio" concern** — the CPI evidence (best point forecasts AND highest ratio) is the perfect defense, but the paper doesn't deploy it.

**Key Should-Fix items:**
- Extend the horse race to KXU3 (Unemployment) and KXFRM (Mortgage Rates) — FRED mappings already exist
- Extend serial correlation analysis to all 11 series
- GDP temporal snapshot sensitivity analysis
- Brief real-time monitoring specification
