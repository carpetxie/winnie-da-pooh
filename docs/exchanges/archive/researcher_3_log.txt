Everything is consistent. The iteration 3 changes are complete:

**Summary of Iteration 3 Changes:**

1. **CPI Leave-One-Out Analysis** (new code in experiment13/run.py): All 14 CPI LOO ratios remain above 1.0 (tail-aware range [1.36, 1.78]). This is a major upgrade — the CPI finding is now as robust to outlier influence as the JC finding.

2. **Formal Heterogeneity Test** (new code in experiment13/run.py): Permutation test p<0.001, Mann-Whitney p=0.003, r=−0.64. The CPI-JC divergence is formally statistically significant.

3. **Paper updates**: Abstract, Section 2, mechanisms section, bottom line, and methodology all updated with the new results.

4. **Researcher response** written to `docs/exchanges/researcher_response.md`.

The key insight for this iteration: the CPI claim was the paper's weakest link (the reviewer scored it "suggestive-to-conclusive"). The CPI LOO analysis transforms it — all 14 LOO ratios > 1.0 means no single event drives the finding, and the formal heterogeneity test confirms the CPI-JC divergence is real. Combined with the existing CI, PIT, and temporal evidence, CPI miscalibration is now a robust finding.
