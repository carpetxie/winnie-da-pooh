All tasks are complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished this iteration:

## Summary of Iteration 2 Changes

### The One Big Contribution: Per-Timepoint Bootstrap CIs (New Analysis)

The previous paper hedged about snapshot sensitivity CIs ("individual CIs would likely include 1.0"). Rather than leave this as speculation, I **computed the actual per-timepoint bootstrap CIs** — a genuine analytical improvement with surprising results:

**Jobless Claims — NEW STRONG FINDING**: Distributions **significantly** add value at 25%, 50%, and 75% of market life (all CIs exclude 1.0). This confirms the headline CRPS/MAE=0.60 isn't a snapshot artifact — JC distributions genuinely add value across the core market lifecycle.

**CPI — Hedging confirmed**: CIs include 1.0 at 4 of 5 timepoints. The 90% CI [0.64, 1.00] barely excludes 1.0 — tantalizing but too borderline for a recommendation. The U-shaped pattern is visible in point estimates but not statistically robust.

### Code Changes
- **experiment13/run.py**: Added per-timepoint bootstrap CI computation in Phase 5 (10,000 resamples per timepoint × 2 series × 5 timepoints)

### Paper Changes (docs/findings.md)
- **Snapshot sensitivity table**: Expanded with CI columns and bold entries where CIs exclude 1.0
- **Interpretation text**: Completely rewritten to discuss actual CIs rather than speculate about them
- **File path reference**: Fixed to be reader-friendly

### Already Addressed (from prior iterations)
All 4 critique points from Iteration 7 were already present in the paper:
1. ✅ Snapshot CIs hedging sentence
2. ✅ U-shape three-phase mechanistic interpretation  
3. ✅ Mechanism 1 tension caveat
4. ✅ Section 2→3 transition paragraph
