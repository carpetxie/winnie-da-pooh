All tasks are complete. Here's a summary of what was done in iteration 2:

## Summary of Changes

### Must-Fixes Addressed
1. **Worked example factual error**: Replaced KXJOBLESSCLAIMS-26JAN22 (wrong numbers: CRPS=751) with KXJOBLESSCLAIMS-25JUN12 (CRPS=4,455, ratio=0.165) — a cleaner illustration
2. **Serial correlation CI prose error**: Fixed "[0.90, 2.58] barely excludes 1.0" → correctly states it "includes 1.0" and reframes CPI conclusion to rest on converging evidence

### New Code & Analyses (4 new analyses implemented)
1. **Tail-aware LOO** (`experiment13/run.py`): All 16 ratios < 1.0, range [0.64, 0.69] — confirmed bulletproof
2. **CRPS − MAE signed difference test** (`experiment13/run.py`): JC p=0.001 (14/16 negative) — strongest individual test in paper. CPI p=0.091 (10/14 positive)
3. **Tail-aware temporal table** (`experiment13/run.py`): JC CIs exclude 1.0 at ALL 5 timepoints — entire lifecycle adds value
4. **Tail-aware horse race** (`experiment13/horse_race.py`): Kalshi MAE drops 0.082→0.068. vs Random Walk: p_adj=0.059 (was 0.102), already at 80% power

### Key Upgrades to Paper Claims
- JC finding now backed by **signed difference p=0.001** and **5/5 temporal significance**
- Horse race: Random walk comparison upgraded from "suggestive" (p_adj=0.102) to "borderline significant" (p_adj=0.059)
- TIPS and trailing mean comparisons now significant at raw level (p=0.045, p=0.021)
- Internal metric consistency resolved: tail-aware used throughout as primary
